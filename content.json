Don’t delete me, I’m very helpful! I can be recovered anyway in the Utils tab of the Settings dialog. DocumentsStackEdit stores your documents in your browser, which means all your documents are automatically saved locally and are accessible offline! Note: StackEdit is accessible offline after the application has been loaded for the first time. Your local documents are not shared between different browsers or computers. Clearing your browser’s data may delete all your local documents! Make sure your documents are synchronized with Google Drive or Dropbox (check out the Synchronization section). Create a documentThe document panel is accessible using the button in the navigation bar. You can create a new document by clicking New document in the document panel. Switch to another documentAll your local documents are listed in the document panel. You can switch from one to another by clicking a document in the list or you can toggle documents using Ctrl+[ and Ctrl+]. Rename a documentYou can rename the current document by clicking the document title in the navigation bar. Delete a documentYou can delete the current document by clicking Delete document in the document panel. Export a documentYou can save the current document to a file by clicking Export to disk from the menu panel. Tip: Check out the Publish a document section for a description of the different output formats. SynchronizationStackEdit can be combined with Google Drive and Dropbox to have your documents saved in the Cloud. The synchronization mechanism takes care of uploading your modifications or downloading the latest version of your documents. Note: Full access to Google Drive or Dropbox is required to be able to import any document in StackEdit. Permission restrictions can be configured in the settings. Imported documents are downloaded in your browser and are not transmitted to a server. If you experience problems saving your documents on Google Drive, check and optionally disable browser extensions, such as Disconnect. Open a documentYou can open a document from Google Drive or the Dropbox by opening the Synchronize sub-menu and by clicking Open from…. Once opened, any modification in your document will be automatically synchronized with the file in your Google Drive / Dropbox account. Save a documentYou can save any document by opening the Synchronize sub-menu and by clicking Save on…. Even if your document is already synchronized with Google Drive or Dropbox, you can export it to a another location. StackEdit can synchronize one document with multiple locations and accounts. Synchronize a documentOnce your document is linked to a Google Drive or a Dropbox file, StackEdit will periodically (every 3 minutes) synchronize it by downloading/uploading any modification. A merge will be performed if necessary and conflicts will be detected. If you just have modified your document and you want to force the synchronization, click the button in the navigation bar. Note: The button is disabled when you have no document to synchronize. Manage document synchronizationSince one document can be synchronized with multiple locations, you can list and manage synchronized locations by clicking Manage synchronization in the Synchronize sub-menu. This will let you remove synchronization locations that are associated to your document. Note: If you delete the file from Google Drive or from Dropbox, the document will no longer be synchronized with that location. PublicationOnce you are happy with your document, you can publish it on different websites directly from StackEdit. As for now, StackEdit can publish on Blogger, Dropbox, Gist, GitHub, Google Drive, Tumblr, WordPress and on any SSH server. Publish a documentYou can publish your document by opening the Publish sub-menu and by choosing a website. In the dialog box, you can choose the publication format: Markdown, to publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it (GitHub for instance), HTML, to publish the document converted into HTML (on a blog for example), Template, to have a full control of the output. Note: The default template is a simple webpage wrapping your document in HTML format. You can customize it in the Advanced tab of the Settings dialog. Update a publicationAfter publishing, StackEdit will keep your document linked to that publication which makes it easy for you to update it. Once you have modified your document and you want to update your publication, click on the button in the navigation bar. Note: The button is disabled when your document has not been published yet. Manage document publicationSince one document can be published on multiple locations, you can list and manage publish locations by clicking Manage publication in the menu panel. This will let you remove publication locations that are associated to your document. Note: If the file has been removed from the website or the blog, the document will no longer be published on that location. Markdown ExtraStackEdit supports Markdown Extra, which extends Markdown syntax with some nice features. Tip: You can disable any Markdown Extra feature in the Extensions tab of the Settings dialog.
